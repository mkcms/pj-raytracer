# pj-raytracer #

This is an old school project of mine.

It is a raytracer implemented in pure Java that renders 3D models created by
old Cyberware scanners and uses SGI Image File Format for coloring the model.

The renderer runs in a Java AWT GUI and by default displays `glowa` model which
contains a human head scan.
